    "# OptaPy - OptaPlanner in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "OptaPy is an **AI constraint solver for Python** to optimize the Vehicle Routing Problem, Employee Rostering, Maintenance Scheduling, Task Assignment, School Timetabling, Cloud Optimization, Conference Scheduling, Job Shop Scheduling, Bin Packing and many more planning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "OptaPy wraps the [OptaPlanner](https://www.optaplanner.org/) engine internally, but using OptaPy in Python is significantly slower than using OptaPlanner in Java or Kotlin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING:  OptaPy is an experimental technology. It is at least 20 times slower than using OptaPlanner in Java or Kotlin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is OptaPlanner?\n",
    "\n",
    "OptaPlanner is an AI constraint solver. It optimizes planning and scheduling problems, such as the Vehicle Routing Problem, Employee Rostering, Maintenance Scheduling, Task Assignment, School Timetabling, Cloud Optimization, Conference Scheduling, Job Shop Scheduling, Bin Packing and many more. Every organization faces such challenges: assign a limited set of constrained resources (employees, assets, time and/or money) to provide products or services. OptaPlanner delivers more efficient plans, which reduce costs and improve service quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints apply on plain domain objects and can call existing code. There’s no need to input constraints as mathematical equations. Under the hood, OptaPlanner combines sophisticated Artificial Intelligence optimization algorithms (such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, Late Acceptance and other metaheuristics) with very efficient score calculation and other state-of-the-art constraint solving techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example: School Timetabling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model the domain objects and constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to assign each lesson to a time slot and a room. The model is divided into four kind of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Facts\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem facts are facts about the problem. As such, they do not change during solving (and thus cannot have any planning variables). An example problem fact is shown below:"
